# eCommerce Data Science: EDA, Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation 

This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing eCommerce transaction data. The project involves the following tasks:

## Tasks

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis of customer, product, and transaction datasets.
- Generated business insights related to customer distribution, product performance, price sensitivity, and sales trends.

### 2. Lookalike Model:
- Built a model to identify similar customers based on transaction history and profile information.
- Recommended the top 3 lookalike customers for each of the first 20 customers, along with similarity scores.

### 3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering):
- Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers based on both profile and transaction data.

- Evaluated clustering performance using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin index and silhouette score.
- Visualized clusters using dimensionality reduction (PCA).
